<h3>Trouble with Part 4: Interaction: </h3>

I was having difficulty getting the interactivty working for part 4. I switched my d3 library to v4, because I was finding it easier to get the visualizations working. However, I found it was harder to find helpful tutorials when it came to mouse actions and interactivity. 



<h3>Collaboration: </h3>
I worked with Ben Galassi for a good portion of the first parts (parts 1 and 2, and a little bit of part 3). 

Sources: 
I listed a number of sources in the source code on index.html. The plan is to remove those comments before Friday and include those notes in this readme. (We'll see if I do it in time.)
